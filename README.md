# Bit-Manipulation

This repository contains a collection of programs demonstrating various bit manipulation techniques and algorithms. It is aimed at how bitwise operations work and how to apply them in solving problems efficiently.

## Topics Covered
- Basics of Bit Manipulation
  - Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT
  - Left and Right Shift
  - Bit Masking
  - Setting, Clearing, and Toggling Bits
- Common Bit Manipulation Algorithms
  - Counting Set Bits (Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm)
  - Checking if a number is a power of 2
  - Checking if a number is even or odd using bits
- Swapping Numbers without a Temp Variable
- Reversing Bits
- Bitwise Sum
- Finding the Only Non-Repeated Element
- Efficient XOR Tricks
- Hamming Distance
- Sum of Two Integers without Using + or -
- Efficient Algorithms for Large Numbers (e.g., finding the nth power of 2)
